                <p>On my own perspective, my life during pandemic is not really fine, we have a lot to struggle like finding food as soon as possible, staying home for safety purposes, and waiting for the pandemic to end.</p><br><p>In today's situation (the pandemic) the process of teaching and learning is too difficult. There were times that you might feel like your lossing your hope to continue your Education. Rate of suicidal issues of students are increasing because they can't cope, understand the lesson alone. And one of the factors that affects the studies of students is having no gadget to use and poor internet connection.</p><br><p>That's why, I realize that teachers are vital in our daily life and in our Education. They are our strength for us to develop and enhance our skill, they are also our weaknesses without them our life is like an empty bottle, no learnings, no new information especially to those students who are slow learners.</p><br><p>There are so many things I learned and appreciated during this quarantine and I thank God for blessing me always and didn't leave my side.</p>

                <p>Life as a student is a bumpy ride. During these hard times, we are expected to be strong and to have high marks. Little did everyone know, we are also having a hard time keeping ourselves awake answering modules, and doing performance tasks up until late in the evening.</p><br><p>We are suffering and stuck in between "should I go on" or "should I just quit". Asking ourselves if "am I good enough", "what if I didn't meet their expectations? " Adding up the worrisome pandemic, the shortage of resources, and the increasing number of deaths.</p><br><p>One day, the light will shine in this dark and scary place. All the overthinking, anxiety, and depression will all fade away. One day we will get our self-esteem back again. We will smile and together will be living under the same sun, singging the songs of freedom.</p><br><p>But at the end of the day, I know that in every circumstance there is always something to be thankful for, and I appreciative for my situation right now.</p>
